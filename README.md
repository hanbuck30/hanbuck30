## ðŸ”§ Notable Projects

### [NeuroTalk Decoding](https://github.com/hanbuck30/NeuroTalk-Decoding)[Private now]
Traditional invasive methods have often achieved high performance in decoding. However, decoding using non-invasive methods like EEG is very challenging, especially for imagined speech, where understanding a user's intent through mere thoughts is particularly difficult. To address this, we developed a method that achieved high performance

- **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, NumPy, MATLAB, Pandas
- **Features:**
  - Achieved a high F1 score
  - Plan to further develop this method not only for decoding but also for language processing
  - It takes about 7 Hours for training.

### [Nonlinear Time Series Prediction for Financial Data](https://github.com/hanbuck30/financial-data-predict)[Public]
This project investigates the use of advanced neural network models for predicting nonlinear time series data, specifically focusing on applications in BCI and financial markets.

- **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Pytorch
- **Features:**
  - Optimized the hyperparameters of the ESN and the TA using a heuristic optimization technique, GA (Genetic Algorithm)
  - Aimed for higher profits by utilizing optimized algorithms and TA tailored to each stock
  - Achieved stable and high returns by considering not only the profitability but also the Maximum Drawdown (MDD)

### [ESN-Pytorch](https://github.com/hanbuck30/Pytorch_ESN)[Public]
Pytorch version of ESN. Learning algorithms include FORCE, inverse matrix, and Gradient Descent. Unlike traditional ESNs, large storage nodes can be used using memory much more efficiently.
