## ðŸ”§ Notable Projects

### [NeuroTalk Decoding](https://github.com/hanbuck30/NeuroTalk-Decoding)[Private now]
Traditional invasive methods have often achieved high performance in decoding. However, decoding using non-invasive methods like EEG is very challenging, especially for imagined speech, where understanding a user's intent through mere thoughts is particularly difficult. To address this, we developed a method that achieved high performance

- **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, NumPy, MATLAB, Pandas
- **Features:**
  - Achieved a high F1 score
  - Plan to further develop this method not only for decoding but also for language processing
  - It takes about 7 Hours for training.

### [Nonlinear Time Series Prediction for Financial Data](https://github.com/hanbuck30/nonlinear-timeseries-prediction)[Public]
This project investigates the use of advanced neural network models for predicting nonlinear time series data, specifically focusing on applications in BCI and financial markets.

- **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Pytorch
- **Features:**
  - Implementation of neural network models optimized for time series prediction
  - Application to BCI signal processing and financial forecasting
